🌀 Step 1: Component Function Starts

When React renders <Dashbord />:

export function Dashbord() {
  const [modelOpen ,setModelOpen] = useState(false); 
  const {contents , refresh} = useContent();


useState(false)

Creates a state variable modelOpen with initial value false.

setModelOpen is the function to update it.

useContent() runs (hook runs immediately during render).

Inside useContent:

useState([]) → sets contents = [] initially.

Defines refresh function (doesn’t execute yet).

Registers its useEffect (to run after render).

So after this line, you have:

modelOpen = false

contents = []

refresh = function that fetches data

🌀 Step 2: useEffect in Dashbord registers
useEffect(() =>{
  refresh();
}, [modelOpen])


This tells React:
“After the component renders, run refresh() once. Then, run it again whenever modelOpen changes.”

At this moment, it does not run yet — only after the render completes.

🌀 Step 3: JSX Render

React now builds the UI tree from your return:

return (
  <div className="m-4">
    <Sidebar/>
    <div className="ml-72">
      <CreateContentModel open={modelOpen} onClose={() => setModelOpen(false)} />
      <div className="flex justify-end gap-4 ml-72">
        <Button onClick={() => setModelOpen(true)} ... text="share"/>
        <Button ... text="Add content"/>
      </div>
      <div className='flex gap-4 flex-wrap'>
        {contents.map(...)}   // but contents = [] now, so nothing renders
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
)


Sidebar, CreateContentModel, and Buttons are shown.

contents.map(...) → nothing yet, since contents is empty.

🌀 Step 4: Side Effects Run (after first paint)
4.1 useEffect from useContent
useEffect(() => {
  refresh();
  let interval = setInterval(() => refresh(), 10000);
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, [])


Runs right after first render.

Calls refresh() immediately → makes an API call to backend.

Starts a 10s interval to call refresh() repeatedly.

4.2 useEffect from Dashbord
useEffect(() => {
  refresh();
}, [modelOpen])


Also runs right after first render (because every effect runs once after mount).

Calls refresh() again.

⚡ This means your first mount triggers two API calls (one from useContent, one from Dashbord).

🌀 Step 5: API Response Arrives

Inside refresh():

axios.get(`${BACKEND_URL}/api/v1/content`, { headers: {...} })
  .then(response => setContents(response.data.content))


When data arrives from backend, setContents updates state.

That triggers React to re-render Dashbord with new contents.

🌀 Step 6: Re-render with Updated State

Now contents is no longer [], it has the content objects.
So in JSX:

{contents.map(({type, link, title}) => (
  <Card type={type} link={link} title={title}/>
))}


Cards get displayed with the actual content.

🌀 Step 7: Later User Interaction

If user clicks Share button → setModelOpen(true)

React re-renders with modelOpen = true.

Modal opens (CreateContentModel has open=true).

After render, the useEffect([modelOpen]) in Dashbord runs → calls refresh() again.

If modal closes (setModelOpen(false)) → same effect, another refresh.

📌 Final Flow Summary

Dashbord renders → initializes state and calls useContent.

JSX renders with contents = [].

After render:

useContent’s useEffect runs → fetch + interval.

Dashbord’s useEffect runs → fetch again.

Data arrives → setContents → re-render with data.

Every 10s, refresh() auto fetches.

Opening/closing modal also triggers fetch.

👉 So yes, useContent runs during render, and both useEffects (inside useContent and Dashbord) trigger API calls after render.

Do you want me to also show you how to avoid the duplicate API call on mount (since right now it’s fetching twice initially)?






                                               // IMP 
                       In React:

First → React runs the component function (Dashbord in your case).

This builds the UI tree (JSX → virtual DOM).

Then → React paints it on screen.

After that → useEffect runs.

👉 That’s why we say:
useEffect runs after the first render (mount), not during render.

So in your case:

Dashbord() runs → React sees useEffect(() => { refresh(); }, [modelOpen]).

It schedules that effect to run after the paint.

Once the UI is visible, React runs refresh().

That makes the API call, updates contents, and re-renders.
